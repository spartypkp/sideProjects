# sideProjects
A collection of random (extremely) projects I have created in my free time. Some code snippets have been copied from various online sources. 

BriefMe: An XCode Project of an app I have been developing in my free time. My first ever adventure into iOs app development, it's an extremely basic (and failed) attempt to make an alarm clock/scheduler/news app.

Calls: Python file which I created to create a better visualization of the value of a long call option for a certain stock ticker. Intended to visualize and model the relationship in intrinsic price, time value, and other factors such as realized volatility according to the BLack Scholes model. Still a work in progress

Concentration: Another XCode project of an app I developed in my free time. My second entry into app development. This program was created following the free online Stanford iOs app development course. First time I learned and applied coding is Swift and SwiftUI.

Media Bot: Python file which uses a webdriver to automaticallyt create a chrome window. Can interface with a website through the python console and perform a variet of actions. This was my first test to automated chrome browsing, currently views a social media webpage and does some actions.

Scheduler: Python file which reads in a schedule (schoolwork) which is input in a certain format and sends the schedule as a text message through the Twilio API. Then compiles a schedule and will display upcoming due dates in different formats.

downloadSorter: Python file which will automatically sort my downloads folder every time an action is detected. I used this during my fall semester of 2020 in order to sort the multitude of different coding file types into their respective classes folder. Is meant to run in the background whenever the computer is running

send_sms: Python file which sends a text message through the Twilio API to myself. Was the original predecessor of my Scheduler app, although this version required hard coding of my schedule into the source code itself.
